# Overview

I have created a new Portfolio for myself in React. It was time to update my old portfolio because it was written in basic HTML, JAVASCRIPT and CSS. Very basic. I love the components of React because of the organization. I made my new portfolio a single page site, but if I wanted to link to more pages in the future, the components make it easy to have consistency. 

In order to run this, do an npm install, then npm start. CTRL + Click on the localhost instance that shows up in your terminal.

# Web Pages

I created this as a single page site with multiple links going to various components. I have a link for the projects, about me and contact me. 

# Development Environment

# Future Work
* I have other projects that I want to add, so I would like to make it so when there are lots of projects listed, or all, that lightbox on the main page has a horizontal scroll feature or arrows. 
* I want the videos to be pulled from a website, like youtube or screenpal, instead of having to have them in my code.
